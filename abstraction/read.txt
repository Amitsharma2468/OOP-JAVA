👉 What is Abstraction?

Abstraction means hiding the implementation details and showing only the important features to the user.

Think of it like driving a car:

You just use the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes.

You don’t need to know how the engine or gearbox works inside.

That’s abstraction — showing only what’s necessary, hiding the complexity.

📌 How Abstraction is done in Java?

Abstract Class

A class declared with the keyword abstract.

It can have both abstract methods (without body) and normal methods (with body).

Abstract classes cannot be directly instantiated (you can’t create an object of them).

Interface

A blueprint of a class.

It contains only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default and static methods).

A class implements an interface to provide actual functionality.

🔑 Key Points

Abstraction focuses on “what to do”, not “how to do”.

It helps in reducing complexity and increasing code flexibility.

Done using abstract classes and interfaces.

👉 Easy way to remember:

Encapsulation = Data hiding (hiding variables/data).

Abstraction = Implementation hiding (hiding internal logic).
