ðŸ”¹ Method Overloading in Java
1. What is Method Overloading?

When a class has more than one method with the same name but different parameter lists.

The compiler decides which method to call based on the number or type of arguments.

2. Rules for Overloading

Methods must have the same name.

But must differ in:

Number of parameters, OR

Type of parameters, OR

Order of parameters.

Return type alone cannot distinguish overloaded methods.

3. Benefits

Increases readability of the code.

Allows us to use one method name for similar actions but with different inputs.

4. Real-Life Example (Concept)

Imagine a Calculator:

add(int a, int b) â†’ adds two integers.

add(double a, double b) â†’ adds two doubles.

add(int a, int b, int c) â†’ adds three integers.

All methods are called add, but they handle different inputs â†’ this is method overloading.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
Method overloading = same name, different parameters.
