ğŸ”¹ Static Student Count Example (Concept)

Suppose we have a class Student.

Each student has their own name, id, department â†’ these are non-static variables.

But we also want to count how many students are created.

For that, we use a static variable called studentCount.

Every time a new Student object is created, we increase this static count by 1.

Since itâ€™s static, the same studentCount is shared by all objects.

ğŸ‘‰ Real-life meaning:

If 3 students take admission, the university keeps a single counter (not each student separately).

That counter is like our static variable.
