Meaning: Inheritance means one class can use the features (variables and methods) of another class. It’s like a child getting qualities from parents.

Why use it:

To reuse code (no need to write same code again).

To make programs organized and simple.

To allow a child class to add its own extra features.

Types:

Single → One child from one parent.

Multilevel → Like Grandparent → Parent → Child.

Hierarchical → One parent, many children.
(Java doesn’t allow multiple parents for one child with classes, only with interfaces.)

Important words:

extends → used to make inheritance.

super → used when child wants to call parent’s features.

Method overriding → child can change parent’s method.

👉 In simple terms: Inheritance in Java means “child class gets features of parent class.”
