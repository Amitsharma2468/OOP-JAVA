Method Overriding in Java

Definition: Method overriding happens when a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.

Rules:

The method in the child class must have the same name, return type, and parameters as in the parent class.

There must be inheritance (extends keyword).

Access modifier in the child method should be same or more accessible (e.g., protected â†’ public).

Only non-static, non-final methods can be overridden.

Why use it?

To achieve runtime polymorphism.

To provide specific implementation in the child class.
