👉 What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism means “many forms”.
In Java, it allows the same method name to perform different actions depending on the situation.

📌 Types of Polymorphism
1. Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism)

Achieved through method overloading.

Same method name, but different parameters (number or type).

The decision about which method to call is made at compile time.

2. Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)

Achieved through method overriding.

A child class provides its own version of a method already defined in the parent class.

The decision about which method to call is made at run time, based on the actual object.

🔑 Summary

Compile-time polymorphism → Method Overloading → Resolved at compile time.

Run-time polymorphism → Method Overriding → Resolved at run time.
