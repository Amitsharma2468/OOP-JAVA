Java OOP â€“ Parameterized Method (Easy Words)

Parameterized Method:

A parameterized method is a method that takes input values (called parameters) to work with.

These inputs help the method do its task with different data each time.

Objects call the method and pass values to it.

Key Points:

Parameters are like ingredients you give to a method.

Makes code flexible and reusable.

Helps objects do different actions using the same method.

Remember:

Parameterized Method = Method that accepts input

Objects give data to the method to use
