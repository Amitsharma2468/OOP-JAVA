Java OOP â€“ Static Variable
ðŸ”¹ What is a Static Variable?

A static variable belongs to the class (not to objects).

It is shared by all objects of that class.

Memory for static variable is created only once when the class is loaded.

It is useful for values that are common to all objects.

ðŸ”¹ Real-Life Example:

Imagine a University.

Every student has their own name, ID, department â†’ (these are instance variables).

But the University Name is same for all students â†’ (this is a static variable).

So:

studentName, studentID, department â†’ different for each student.

universityName â†’ same for all, so we make it static.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
Static variable = one copy, shared by all objects.
