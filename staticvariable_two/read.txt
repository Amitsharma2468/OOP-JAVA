ðŸ”¹ Static Variable

Declared with the static keyword.

Belongs to the class, not to individual objects.

Shared by all objects of the class.

Only one copy exists in memory, regardless of how many objects are created.

Can be accessed using the class name (e.g., ClassName.variable).

Lifetime: exists for the entire duration of the program.

Example use: counters, database connections, constants.

ðŸ”¹ Non-Static (Instance) Variable

Declared without the static keyword.

Belongs to a specific object (instance).

Each object has its own separate copy.

Changes made to one objectâ€™s variable do not affect others.

Accessed through an object reference (e.g., obj.variable).

Lifetime: exists as long as the object exists.

Example use: name, age, salary of employees (different for each object).

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

Static = one copy shared by all objects (class level).

Non-Static = each object has its own copy (object level).
