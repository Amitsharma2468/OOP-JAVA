Java OOP â€“ Constructor Overloading

Constructor Overloading means having more than one constructor in the same class.

Each constructor has the same name (class name) but different parameters (number or type).

Java decides which constructor to run based on the arguments you give while creating the object.

It is used to create objects in different ways with different initial values.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
Constructor overloading lets you give multiple doors to create an object. You can enter with different kinds of values, and Java will know which door (constructor) to use.
