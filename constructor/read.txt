Java OOP â€“ Constructor

A constructor is a special method in Java.

Its job is to create and set up objects.

It has the same name as the class.

A constructor runs automatically when an object is made.

It does not return any value, not even void.

There are two main types:

Default constructor â†’ made by Java if you donâ€™t write one.

Parameterized constructor â†’ lets you pass values while making an object.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
A constructor is like a welcome setup for an object. When you create an object, the constructor runs and gives it the first setup values.
