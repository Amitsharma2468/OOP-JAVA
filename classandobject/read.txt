Java OOP â€“ Class and Object (Easy Words)

Class:

A class is a plan or blueprint.

It tells what data (properties) and actions (methods) objects will have.

It is not real, just a design.

Object:

An object is a real thing made from a class.

Each object has its own data.

Objects can do the actions (methods) of the class.

Key Points:

Class = plan or design

Object = real thing or instance

Many objects can come from one class

Remember:

Class tells what something will have

Object is the actual thing you use
