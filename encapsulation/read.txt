Encapsulation is like putting your important stuff in a box.  This box hides the stuff inside, so no one can just grab it.

Getter (To get): This is a key to the box that lets you look at what's inside, but not change it.

Setter (To set): This is another key that lets you put new stuff into the box, but it checks to make sure the new stuff is okay first.

In simple terms, encapsulation bundles data and methods together and uses getters and setters as the only way to safely interact with that data.
