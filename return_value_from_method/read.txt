Java OOP â€“ Return Value from Method

A method can do some work and then send back (return) a result.

The value it returns must match the return type declared in the method (like int, String, double, etc.).

If a method does not return anything, its return type is void.

Returning a value allows us to use the result in other parts of the program.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple words:
A method is like a machine. You give it input, it works, and then it can return a product (value) back to you.
